*Background* Research suggests that deficits in both executive functioning and trait impulsivity
may play a role in risky sexual behavior. At the neural level, differences in regulation of the
prefrontal cortex have been linked to impulsivity, measured neurocognitively and through self-
report. The relationship between neurocognitive measures of executive control and trait
impulsivity in predicting risky sexual behavior has not been investigated.

*Purpose* To investigate the relationship between neural functioning during the Stroop task and risky sexual behavior, as well as the effect of individual differences in urgent (positive and negative) impulsivity on this relationship.

*Methods* 105 sexually active men who have sex with men (MSM) completed the Stroop task during functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning. They also completed impulsivity
inventories and self-reported their risky sexual behavior (events of condomless anal sex in the last
90 days).

*Results* Risky participants had greater activation than safe participants during the color
congruent condition of the Stroop task in anterior cingulate cortex/dorsomedial prefrontal cortex,
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left frontal pole, and right insula. Across these regions, this neural
activation mediated the link between (positive and/or negative) urgent impulsivity and risky
sexual behavior.

*Conclusions* Findings suggest that the brains of men who engage in risky sexual behavior may
employ a different distribution of cognitive resources during tasks of executive functioning than men who practice safe sex, and that this may relate to differences in the prefrontal cortical/fronto-
insular system responsible for impulse control.
