# Biography

Ben Smith is a postdoctoral researcher in neuroscience at Prof. Elliot Berkman's Social Affective Neuroscience Lab at the University of Oregon.

He completed a PhD in the Social Affective Neuroscience of Decision-making laboratory at the University of Southern California, led by Prof. Steve Read. Decision-making is the common thread in Ben's work, and spans areas including the social neuroscience of risky decision-making, computational modeling of the reward and punishment system during decision-making, the abstract-concrete tangibility axis of the prefrontal cortex, and moral and ideological decision-making.
